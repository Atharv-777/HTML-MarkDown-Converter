### How to use?
You need to have Python Installed on your computer, to know more about Python visit [here](https://wiki.python.org/moin/BeginnersGuide/Download) or directly download it from [Download Page](https://www.python.org/downloads/).<br>
Simply open command line in the directory where `converter.py` is present, and execute the file using following command :
```
$ python3 converter.py
```

Or you can also use the Python IDLE, or any other code editor for this purpose.

After that, just follow the steps that program asks you to do.
- Once you run the `converter.py` file, an `input.txt` file gets generated in the current folder
- You will need to put the original code(HTML or Markdown) into that `input.txt` file, and then press ENTER. 
- After that, the program will convert that code to your desired format, and put the converted code into `output.txt` file.
